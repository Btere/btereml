**Here are some short README for these projects:**

### **Arrhythmia Detection**
**Binary Classification of Cardiac Arrhythmia**

This project focuses on the binary classification of cardiac arrhythmia. Given a set of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, the model aims to accurately determine whether an arrhythmia is present or not.

**Key Components:**

* **Data Preprocessing:**
  * Signal cleaning and normalization
  * Feature extraction (e.g., time-domain, frequency-domain, time-frequency domain features)
* **Model Architecture:**
  * Deep learning model: CNN
* **Training and Evaluation:**
  * Model training using appropriate loss functions and optimizers
  * Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall

### **Credit Card Fraud Detection**
**Anomaly Detection for Fraudulent Transactions**

This project tackles the problem of credit card fraud detection, which involves identifying fraudulent transactions among legitimate ones.

**Key Components:**

* **Data Analysis:**
  * Exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset and identify patterns
* **Feature Engineering:**
  * Creating meaningful features from raw transaction data
* **Model Selection:**
  * Choosing an appropriate model: Decision trees
* **Model Training and Evaluation:**
  * Training the model on historical data and evaluating its performance on a test set
  * Using metrics like accuracy were used

### **FashionMNIST Optimization**
**Hyperparameter Tuning for FashionMNIST**

This project explores the impact of hyperparameter tuning on the performance of a deep learning model for the FashionMNIST dataset.

**Experiments Conducted:**

* **Increasing Hidden Layers:**
  * Investigating the effect of adding more hidden layers on model accuracy and complexity
